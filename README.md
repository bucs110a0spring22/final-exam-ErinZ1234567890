## SUMMARY:
Please make sure you have completed the soot survey at:
    [soot.binghamton.edu](https://soot.binghamton.edu)

Please list the urls for the APIs you used: http://www.penguinrandomhouse.biz/webservices/rest/
https://dictionaryapi.dev/ 

Summary of Program: This code takes in a penguin random house isbn (13 digits, no hyphens) and prints out the title. It then generates a new title using synonyms for all the words in the title.

Most Challenging topic in the course:
The most challenging topic was definitely the API section. I had never really worked with APIs in python so I was very confused until I got it. And then, since python is awesome, it became a whole lot easier. Also, while trying to do this exam, I spent a very long time setting up x2go and xquartz.
